    "lyrics": "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound\nThat saved a wretch like me\nI once was lost, but now am found\nWas blind, but now I see\n\n'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear\nAnd grace my fears relieved\nHow precious did that grace appear\nThe hour I first believed\n\nThrough many dangers, toils and snares\nI have already come\n'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far\nAnd grace will lead me home"
